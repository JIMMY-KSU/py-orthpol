ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIALS IN PYTHON
================================

This package serves as a Python wrapper for the legacy Fortran code ORTHPOL.
It allows the construction of orthogonal polynomials given a weight function.


DEMOS
=====

I provide several demos that demonstrate how polynomials can be constructed
both from simple weight functions as well as ``scipy.stats`` random variables.
Here is a list of them:

    + demo1.py: Hermite polynomials using a weight function.
    + demo2.py: Laguerre polynomials using a weight function.
    + demo3.py: Chebyshev polynomials using a weight function.
