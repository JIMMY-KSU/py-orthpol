ORTHOGONAL POLYNOMIALS IN PYTHON
================================

Description
-----------

This package serves as a Python wrapper for the legacy Fortran code ORTHPOL.
It allows the construction of orthogonal polynomials given a weight function.


Demos
-----

I provide several demos that demonstrate how polynomials can be constructed
both from simple weight functions as well as ``scipy.stats`` random variables.
Here is a list of them:
+ ``demos/demo1.py``: Hermite polynomials using a weight function.
+ ``demos/demo2.py``: Laguerre polynomials using a weight function.
+ ``demos/demo3.py``: Chebyshev polynomials using a weight function.
